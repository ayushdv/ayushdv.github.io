This exploratory draft of a law and policy paper introduces to its readers some AI use cases under implementation in Government e-Marketplace (GeM)-India's largest electronic platform for public procurement with a gross merchandise value that touched USD 50 Billion recently. It also picks up threads of conversation from several authors and practitioners about risks with, and hence the need for tighter regulation of, application of AI tools in a public procurement scenario that is fundamentally required to be free from biases, conflicts-of-interest and mistakes. To that extent, this draft examines some issues that may go well beyond equating risks with AI use to risks with IT use, raised to the power of âˆž, examining newer aspects such as barter theory principles in a public procurement context for transactions that could really be two-way acquisition processes.
