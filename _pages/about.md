## Background

![An Image of myself](/images/icon_adv.jpeg){: .align-right width="300px"}

🔬 I am a prospective PhD student at the School of Economics at The University of Edinburgh. Starting in October, I’ll be diving into the fascinating world of Game Theory, which aligns perfectly with my passion for strategic thinking and mathematical analysis.

🎓 I hold a BS in Mathematics from IIT Bombay and an MSc in Mathematical Economics and Econometrics from the University of Edinburgh. My academic journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in both theoretical and applied economics, and I'm excited to further my research in this field.

💻 Professionally, I have 10-12 months of experience working in Data Science and Machine Learning. During this time, I’ve honed my skills in various tools and programming languages, including Python, R, SQL, STATA, and PowerBI. My work has involved both independent and collaborative research, which has given me a versatile skill set and a love for problem-solving.

🤓 Beyond my professional and academic pursuits, I have a keen interest in Finance, Statistical Methods, and Deep Learning Methods. I enjoy exploring how these areas intersect with economics and how they can be applied to real-world problems.

## Other Stuff

🎥🏏⚽🏎️ When I’m not immersed in research or working on data projects, I have a few hobbies that keep me entertained. As a self-proclaimed movie buff, I spend a good chunk of my week watching films and logging them on [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/)! My weekends are often filled with catching up on cricket, football, and Formula 1, and I always look forward to diving into a good book, even if it's just occasionally 😢.
