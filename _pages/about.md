## <span style="color: #5a2c91;">About Me</span>

![An Image of myself](/images/icon_adv.jpeg){: .align-right width="200px"}

🔬 I am a prospective PhD student at the School of Economics at the University of Edinburgh. Starting in October 2024, I will begin my research in Game Theory, specifically Multidimensional Signalling Theory. I hold a BS in Mathematics from IIT Bombay and an MSc in Mathematical Economics and Econometrics from the University of Edinburgh.

💻 Professionally, I have 10-12 months of experience in Data Science and Machine Learning. During this time, I’ve worked with various tools and programming languages, including Python, R, SQL, STATA, and PowerBI.

📚 Beyond my professional and academic pursuits, I am keenly interested in Finance, Statistical Methods, and Deep Learning Methods. I wish to explore how these areas intersect with economics and how they can be applied to real-world problems.

🎥🏏⚽🏎️ When I’m not immersed in research or working on data projects, I have many hobbies to keep myself entertained. As a (self-proclaimed) movie buff, I spend a good chunk of my week watching films and logging them on [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/)! My weekends are often filled with catching up on cricket, football, and Formula 1, and I always look forward to diving into a good book.

Thank you for visiting my page! Feel free to explore my research, projects, and more. If you’d like to get in touch, don’t hesitate to reach out!

## <span style="color: #5a2c91;">Purpose of the Website</span>
This website intends to act as a hub of all my academic and professional pursuits. I plan to link my publications, teaching materials, personal/professional/academic projects (past, present and future) and other similar material here. Plus, some miscellaneous stuff as well.
